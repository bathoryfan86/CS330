How do I approach designing software?
- When designing software I try to create a pathway that allows me to outline the project I am working on and improve on the needs later when I am able to. Requirements play a big part as they are the main source of what is needed to make the software work in the end.

  How do I approach developing programs?
- For my scene I tried to create a concept that was easy enough to match my skill level and eventually add my own flare to it. I was able to implement such componenents as shader programs, mesh creation, camera controls, and lighting effects to improve the look of the scene overall. With each milestone I was able to add onto my 3D scene and it was eventually finished by the end of the course so I only had to improve effects here and there.

  How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- Having experience in graphic design can help add to my skillset especially when looking at a future role in the tech industry. The visual learning approach to programming as helped me understand how to add certain functions and see how they are implemented as a result. This course has helped me have a  better understanding of how graphical engineers are able to accomplish on a regular basis.
